## Making Money from the News

This is a demo-based project which uses a time series dataset of financial market information (stock prices) and a news dataset consisting of information about the sentiment of the news as it relates to the stocks. From this information we will predict stock trends.

This is a competition that is hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news).

### Goals

The goal of our project is to explore the use of [Ensemble Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning) with the intricacies of time series data.


### Corpus collection

The data is stored and retrieved as Pandas dataframes in the Kernels environment. Prediction of future stock price returns based on two sources of data:
Market data (2007 to present)- contains financial market information such as opening price, closing price, trading volume, calculated returns, etc.
News data (2007 to present) - contains information about news articles/alerts published about assets, such as article details, sentiment, and other commentary. 
Details of the data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news/data
